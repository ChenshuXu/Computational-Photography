# High Dynamic Range Imaging

## Synopsis

This assignment focuses on the core algorithms behind computing HDR images based on the paper ["Recovering High
 Dynamic Range Radiance Maps from Photographs‚Äù by Debevec & Malik](https://www.pauldebevec.com/Research/HDR/). I implemented the HDR algorithms from the paper and used [contrast limited adaptive histogram equalization (CLAHE)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adaptive_histogram_equalization) to improve the basic HDR image

## Results

### Result of sample image set

Input stack of images:

1 | 2 | 3

Radiance map of BGR channels:

Blue channel | Green channel | Red channel
|---|---|---|
![B](submission/radiance_map_0.png) | ![G](submission/radiance_map_1.png) | ![R](submission/radiance_map_2.png)

- The red and bright area represent the high light intensity 
- The blue and deep area represents the low light intensity

Basic HDR image:

basic HDR | histogram
|---|---|
![basic HDR](submission/basicHDR.png) | ![hist of basic HDR](submission/histCDF_basicHDR.png)

- Produced by min-max normalization of radiance values in each color channel
- The blue bar represents the number of pixels with that brightness value
- The red line represents the cumulative density of pixels

Histogram equalized picture | histogram

- Produced by applying histogram equalization
- The contrast in increased after histogram equalization. However, it introduced too much contrast in the whole image.

- I used [contrast limited adaptive histogram equalization (CLAHE)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adaptive_histogram_equalization) to improve the basic HDR image.
- Each distinct section of the image get improved by histogram equalization
